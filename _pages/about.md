I am a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at [Secondmind.ai](https://www.secondmind.ai) (ex Prowler.io) since February 2018. Beginning in November 2020, I will join Arno Solinâ€™s group at Aalto University as a postdoctoral researcher on a part-time basis. My research interests lie broadly within probabilistic machine learning and reinforcement learning.

I completed a PhD under the supervision of Maneesh Sahani at the Gatsby Computational neuroscience Unit, UK. In my thesis work, I focused on auditory perception and explored how Bayesian theories of perception could account for various perceptual phenomena revealed in controlled psychophysical experiments. I also developped non-parametric methods for statistical data analysis. My undergraduate studies were in electrical engineering (Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France) and cognitive science (Ecole Normale Superieure, France).
